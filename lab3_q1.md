# **Markdown**
***
The Markdown syntax is a way of **structuring** documents and providing styling without having to use **HTML** or **Cascading Style Sheets**. The name is the play on term *markup*, which is the process of editing and layout.

# **Features of GitHub Markdown**
[x] **Simple, symbolic syntax**
[x] **Compatible with HTML for additional rendering**
[x] **Automatically rendered in GitHub**
[x] **Allow for repository information documents**



# **Common GitHub Markdown Text Directives**
| Directive | Use | Example|
| --- | ----------- |------|
| * | Italic | *Italic*|
| ** | Bold |**Bold**|
|~~|Strikethrough|~~Strikethrough~~|
|``|Command|``Command``|
|\ | Escape Characters| \*Two astericks*
You can tell GitHub to ignore (or escape) Markdown formatting by using  ``\``  before the markdown character.

``Let's rename \*our-new-project\* to \* our-old-project\*.``
